    <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>

    <h3>1. Service Scope</h3>
    <p>
      DataRecoverX provides professional data recovery services on a best-effort
      basis. Recovery success cannot be guaranteed due to the condition of devices
      and storage media.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Diagnostics & Approval</h3>
    <p>
      All devices undergo an initial diagnostic assessment. No recovery work will
      proceed without customer approval of the proposed recovery plan and cost.
    </p>

    <h3>3. No Recovery, No Fee</h3>
    <p>
      If the requested data cannot be recovered, no recovery fee will be charged.
      Diagnostic, handling, or shipping costs may still apply if stated in advance.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Repairs</h3>
    <p>
      In some cases, device repair may be required to enable data recovery.
      Any repair work is optional, subject to customer approval, and charged
      separately from data recovery fees.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Data Responsibility</h3>
    <p>
      DataRecoverX is not responsible for pre-existing data corruption, encrypted
      data, overwritten data, or incomplete recovery results.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Device Condition</h3>
    <p>
      Devices received may already be damaged or degraded. While care is taken,
      further deterioration during recovery is possible and accepted by the customer.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Data Retention</h3>
    <p>
      Recovered data is retained for a limited time after service completion.
      Customers are responsible for confirming receipt and backup of recovered data.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Uncollected Devices</h3>
    <p>
      Devices not collected or returned within 60 days of service completion may
      be recycled or disposed of securely.
    </p>

    <h3>9. Liability</h3>
    <p>
      Liability is limited to the amount paid for recovery services. DataRecoverX
      is not liable for indirect or consequential losses.
