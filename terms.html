    <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p class="muted small">
        This is a starter terms page to protect a new Ireland-first service. It’s not legal advice.
        When you grow, consider a solicitor review.
      </p>

      <h3>1) Diagnostics-first process</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        We assess the device to determine feasible recovery options. We will communicate findings and the proposed approach before recovery work begins.
      </p>

      <h3>2) No Recovery, No Fee (recovery work)</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        If we cannot recover the requested data, you will not be charged for recovery work. “Recovery” means obtaining the data requested in a usable form.
        Partial recovery may occur; we will explain what was recovered before any payment is required.
      </p>

      <h3>3) Fees that may still apply</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        Depending on your job, some non-recovery costs may apply, such as diagnostics/handling, parts required for temporary access, or return shipping.
        We will confirm any such costs with you before proceeding.
      </p>

      <h3>4) Customer responsibilities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide accurate information about damage history and symptoms.</li>
        <li>Do not attempt further powering/charging after liquid exposure.</li>
        <li>Back up recovered data promptly once delivered.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5) Data confidentiality</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        We treat your recovered data as confidential. We only access what’s needed to verify recovery.
        See our <a href="privacy.html"><u>Privacy Policy</u></a>.
      </p>

      <h3>6) Risk and limitations</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        Data recovery and board-level repair involve risk. Some devices can fail further during diagnostics or recovery attempts due to existing damage.
        We will use care and professional procedures, but outcomes are not guaranteed.
      </p>

      <h3>7) Device return and shipping</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        We recommend tracked shipping. We are not responsible for carrier loss/damage. Return shipping options are confirmed during the job.
      </p>

      <h3>8) Ownership</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        You confirm you are the lawful owner of the device and data, or are authorised to request recovery.
      </p>
